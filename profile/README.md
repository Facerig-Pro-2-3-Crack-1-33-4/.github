1. Real-Time Facial Tracking
FaceRig Pro uses your webcam to track your facial expressions and movements. It then maps these to a 3D avatar in real-time.
This allows for highly interactive streaming, video creation, or virtual meetings where your virtual avatar mimics your expressions and movements.

The software provides a wide range of avatars, including animals, humans, and fantasy creatures.
You can also import custom avatars if you're a 3D artist, giving you full control over the look and feel of your virtual character.

Beyond just facial expressions, FaceRig Pro supports hand and body motion capture (via webcam or additional hardware like Leap Motion).
The software can capture various facial features such as eyes, mouth, eyebrows, and head movements, making your virtual avatar more lifelike.
4. High-Quality Rendering
FaceRig Pro offers high-quality rendering, ensuring that the avatars look polished and professional, suitable for content creators who want their streams or videos to stand out.

You can place your avatar in different virtual environments. There are predefined backgrounds, or you can create your own, making the interaction even more immersive.
6. Streaming and Recording Tools
The software is optimized for use with platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and Zoom. You can directly integrate it with OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) or XSplit for easy streaming and video production.
You can also record video content directly within the app.

FaceRig Pro, the paid version, offers more advanced features compared to the free version, such as:
Commercial use license (the free version is restricted to non-commercial purposes).
A wider selection of avatars.
Additional customization options, including the ability to create your own unique avatars or import existing 3D models.
